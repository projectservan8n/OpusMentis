## Update These 3 Variables in Railway

**Replace these 3 environment variables:**

```bash
# Old (Development)
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxx

# New (Production) - Copy from Clerk Dashboard
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:**
- `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` must be IDENTICAL

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Error: "Invalid publishable key"
**Fix:** Double-check you copied the LIVE keys, not test keys
- Production keys start with `pk_live_` and `sk_live_`
- Development keys start with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_`

### Error: Infinite redirect loop
**Fix:** Make sure both publishable keys match:
```bash
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_abc123...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_abc123...  ‚Üê Must be identical!
```

### Error: "Clerk: Missing publishable key"
**Fix:** Railway might not have redeployed. Try:
1. Go to Railway ‚Üí Deployments
2. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment

1. **Add domain in Clerk:**

   - Add: `opusmentis.app`

2. **Add domain in Railway:**
   - Railway ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Networking
   - Add custom domain: `opusmentis.app`

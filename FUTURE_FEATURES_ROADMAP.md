## üìä **Feature Prioritization Framework**

When deciding what to build next, evaluate each feature on:

1. **Revenue Impact** (1-10)
   - Will this directly increase revenue?
   - How much? (‚Ç±10K vs ‚Ç±1M)

2. **User Retention** (1-10)
   - Does this make users stay longer?
   - Reduce churn?

3. **Development Effort** (1-10)
   - How long to build? (1 week vs 3 months)
   - Technical complexity?

4. **Competitive Advantage** (1-10)
   - Does Quizlet have this?
   - Is this unique to us?

**Score = (Revenue + Retention + Competitive) / Effort**

**Example:**
- Content Library: (10 + 8 + 10) / 4 = **7.0** (BUILD THIS FIRST)
- Dark Mode: (2 + 3 + 1) / 1 = **6.0** (Nice to have, but not urgent)
